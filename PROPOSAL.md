**Predicting Formula 1 Race Outcomes**
This project aims to predict which drivers will finish in the Top 10 and ideally their exact finishing position in Formula 1 races (those who score points for the Drivers’ Championship) using data from past seasons. Formula 1 is a highly technical and data-driven sport where every race is influenced by many factors such as driver skill, team performance, car reliability, track characteristics and race strategy. Predicting race outcomes is challenging because small differences, like pit stop times or tire management,can completely change the results.

To build the model, I will use data from the Kaggle Formula 1 World Championship (1950– 2024) dataset, which includes detailed information on races, drivers, teams and other relevant variables. The goal is to create a Python-based model capable of estimating the probability of each driver finishing in the Top 10 and predicts their likely position at the end of a race. The model’s predictions will also be compared with pre-race betting odds to study how well data-driven approaches align with market expectations. This analysis may also highlight whether betting markets efficiently reflect available racing data and performance indicators. In addition, the efficiency of the final model will be assessed by testing its predictions on a future race (if possible, depending on the F1 calendar). The idea is to generate predictions before the race begins and then compare them with the actual results afterward.

To complete this project, I will use Python libraries such as pandas and numpy to clean and organize the dataset and test different machine learning models such as regression and random forest algorithms to compare their predictive accuracy. This project combines data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning in a creative sports analytics application.
